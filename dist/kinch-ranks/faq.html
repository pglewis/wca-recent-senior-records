				Kinch Ranks is a system designed to measure competitors' overall performance across all official WCA
				events. The details of how the ranks are calculated can be found in the <a
					href="https://www.speedsolving.com/threads/all-round-rankings-kinchranks.53353/" target="_blank">
					original forum discussion from SpeedSolving.com</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				One thing of note is that Kinch Ranks only scores averages for most events (excluding blindfold events
				and FMC) with
				the philosophy that outlier singles are not useful for a system designed to measure overall performance.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Senior Kinch Ranks calculations are based on official WCA results from known senior competitors (over
				40).
