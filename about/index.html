		<h2>About the Recent Senior Records</h2>
		<p>
			It all started with Michael George's
			<a href="https://wca-seniors.org" target="_blank">Senior Rankings</a> pages,
			and you can read <a href="https://wca-seniors.org/FAQ.html" target="_blank">that background</a>
			here.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fast forward nearly a decade from its very beginnings and the senior cubing community
			is thriving worldwide, with over-40s competing in a wide variety of official events
			every week. This site filters the top recent senior results to see who is out there
			raising the bar for everyone else.
		</p>
		<p>
			A single event result may have multiple rankings if it applies to multiple age groups.
			For example, official results of a 68 year old competitor will be eligible for the over
			40s, over 50s and over 60s rankings. More details about the rankings data can be found
			<a href="https://wca-seniors.org/FAQ.html">here</a>.
		</p>
		<p style="font-style: italic;">
			Note that we only show the most recent records. If someone improves several times in
			the time-period then only the latest achievement will be shown.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many thanks to Michael George, this site could not exist without all his work to
			compile and maintain the senior rankings data.
